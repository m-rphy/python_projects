# python_projects

This is an assortment of fun projects that goes over different methods of scientific computing in python. The projects range from programs that solve any static differential equations, to fourier transformations, and more advanced ideas of scientific computing like multiprocessing and vercotization of algorithms. It is not only calculations though, some files also include component hardware like solar cells, and thermometers. 

In addtion to the scientific computing programs, the repo also includes a file that calculates regressions and imple neural networks from scratch. 

Thanks for taking a look, and if you have any questions, feel free to reach out.
