# python_projects

This is an assortment of fun projects that I've built when I first started coding. The projects range form messing around with string manipulation, to more advanced ideas of scientific computing like multiprocessing and vercotization of algorithms (still fairly elementary). There is also code that calculates regressions and other AI tools, as well as the basics of manipulating files within a program and incorporating hardware, like solar cells, and thermometers. 

Thanks for taking a look, and if you have any questions, feel free to reach out.
