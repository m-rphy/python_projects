#       This is program that does a few different things



#       a. Prompts the user for a non-zero angle in degrees

#       b. Continues to reprompt the user unless the input is acceptable

#       c. Prompts the user for a number, â‰¤ 25, of terms to sum in a series

#       d. Continues to reprompt the user unless the input is acceptable

#       e. Calculates, using a function you have defined called sind(), the sine of the angle

#       provided by the user. This function must sum a series to the number of terms

#       requested, and may not use any predefined Python math functions.

#       f. Calculates the sine of the angle using math.sin()

#       g. Prints out a quantitative comparison between the two answers including the ratio

#       and the absolute difference.
